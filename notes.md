# work log
  * _beginning reading thinking in react_
  * _finished reading thinking in react_
  * _beginning planning/drawing out UI_

  * _this has been a difficult section, I have been thinking solely of functionality and nothing of layout. It took far longer  than expected to get even the first draft done. I would like to have something less conventional, but will work with this layout for now. It will work for setting up and housing all the logic..._

  * spending the remainder of the day working on getting xcode up and running and looking at the ReactNative Docs.
