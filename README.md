## A Posture Fix

## Project Goal: to help people improve posture and decrease discomfort throughout a work day

## Description
  * A Posture Fix _is an app to help guide you toward better poster. This may seem like a simple task upon first glance, but poor posture is an epidemic in our society. Believe it or not, most people do not even know what "good posture" is! Poor posture can lead to many debilitating chronic problems such as arthritis and bulging discs in the spine. Poor posture can also be at the root of other problems such as numbness in the hands, chronic upper and lower back pain, and other less definable problems._
    A posture fix is here to help! It is an app designed to help you discover what good posture is. Once defined, it will help you find a program that fits into your life. A Posture Fix will help keep you on track with your desired goals by providing you with ample resources, tools and examples.
